Multi-Agent AI Software Engineering Simulator

This project simulates a real-world software engineering team using AI agents.

Workflow:
User Goal → Product Manager → Tech Lead → Developer → QA → Iterative Improvement

The system:

- Breaks goals into tasks
- Refines architecture
- Generates implementation plans
- Critiques outputs
- Iteratively improves quality
- Stores shared memory across agents

Features:
• Multi-agent architecture
• Shared memory system
• Iterative critic loop with scoring
• Convergence detection
• Real-world engineering simulation

Tech Stack:
Python
Gemini API
JSON memory persistence
Prompt engineering

How to Run:

1. Clone repo
2. Create .env
3. Add GEMINI_API_KEY
4. Run main.py
